    Update an object and then sync it with an external application.

    It will deepcopy the object into whatever is named in the 'as'
    clause, run the 'with' code block (which presumably alters the
    object).  Then the update() method on the original object will be
    called with a dict containing only changed fields, and kwargs
    passed to this function.

    If an exception is thrown by update(), the original object will be restored,
    otherwise the updated object will be returned.

    Usage:
    with update(myrecord) as myrecord:
       myrecord.lastname = 'Smith'
       myrecord.address.zipcode = '27707'
