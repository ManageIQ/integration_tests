""" Simple callback handler routine

Signals are a simple way of notifying the framework that something has happened.
Currently we are using them to notify and take action when we _know_ that certain
caches have become stale and need to be invalidated. The example below shows this.

.. code-block:: python

   import signals
   from fixtures.pytest_store import store
   from utils import clear_property_cache


   def invalidate_server_details():
       clear_property_cache(store.current_appliance,
                            'configuration_details', 'zone_description')
   signals.register_callback('server_details_changed', invalidate_server_details)

Or by using a decorator:

.. code-block:: python

   from signals import on_signal
   from fixtures.pytest_store import store

   @on_signal("server_details_changed")
   def invalidate_server_details():
       clear_property_cache(store.current_appliance,
                            'configuration_details', 'zone_description')


Here we create a function to do the work of invalidating the cache and register it
to the signal name 'server_details_changed'. Now whenever something in the framework
changes anything to do with server details it will use the fire function like so.

.. code-block:: python

   import signals

   signals.fire('server_details_changed')

The user who fires off the signal doesn't need to worry about what should happen
when the server details change. They fire the signal and the framework will take the
appropriate action as defined in the callback handler.

Mutliple callbacks can be assigned to the same signal, and can be augmented with args
and kwargs to be able to pass extra information to the callback function.

Current list of signals defined and their usage

====================== ========================================================================
Name                   Usage
====================== ========================================================================
server_details_changed Signal used when the main details of a server has been changed, name etc
server_config_changed  Signal used when the main configuration yaml has been altered
