"""uses_*: Provides a set of fixtures used to mark tests for filtering on the command-line.

Tests using these fixtures directly or indirectly can be filtered using py.test's
``-k`` filter argument. For example, run tests that use the ssh client::

    py.test -k uses_ssh

Additionally, tests using one of the fixtures listed in :py:attr:`appliance_marks` will be marked
with `is_appliance`, for easily filtering out appliance tests, e.g::

    py.test -k 'not is_appliance'

All fixtures created by this module will have the ``uses_`` prefix.

Note:
    ``is_appliance`` is a mark that will be dynamically set based on fixtures used,
    but is not a fixture itself.
