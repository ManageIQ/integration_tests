"""smoke: Mark a test as a smoke test to be run as early as possible

Mark a single test as a smoke test, moving it to the beginning of a test run.

The --halt-on-smoke-test-failure command-line argument will halt after running the smoke tests
if any smoke tests fail.

This mark must be used with caution, as marked tests must be able to run out of order,
and in isolation.

Furthermore, smoke tests are an excellent target for the requires_test mark
since they're run first.
