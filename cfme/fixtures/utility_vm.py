""" The utility_vm is a vm that is meant to serve various services that the
tests are requiring.

The VM is spawned from the template that can be prepared using tooling in
`scripts/utility-vm`. There is a README that you should read to get more info.

When the VM is created, we need to find the IP to conenct to. The  This is done by
attempting to create a tcp connection to an IPs retrieved from the provider the
VM was spawned on. Each service is on different port so there are fixtures for
obtaining the IP for each service.

Note it may not be possible to use ping to find the VM responding as the ping
may not be available in the docker image. But TCP certainly will be available.

Note that using ping is also problematic because the OS may be responing on
ping, but the required service may not be up and ready.
