"""A generalized framowork for handling test blockers.

Currently handling Bugzilla, GitHub and JIRA issues. For extensions, see this file and
:py:mod:`cfme.utils.blockers`.

If you want to mark test with blockers, use meta mark ``blockers`` and specify a list of the
blockers. The blockers can be directly the objects of :py:class:`cfme.utils.blockers.Blocker`
subclasses, but you can use just plain strings that will get resolved into the objects when
required.

Example comes:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.meta(
        blockers=[
            BZ(123456),             # Will get resolved to BZ obviously
            GH(1234),               # Will get resolved to GH if you have default repo set
            GH("owner/repo:issue"), # Otherwise you need to use this syntax
            # Generic blocker writing - (<engine_name>#<blocker_spec>)
            # These work for any engine that is in :py:mod:`utils.blockers`
            "BZ#123456",            # Will resolve to BZ
            "GH#123",               # Will resolve to GH (needs default repo specified)
            "GH#owner/repo:123",    # Will resolve to GH
            # Shortcut writing
            123456,                 # Will resolve to BZ
            'FOO-42',               # Will resolve to JIRA
        ]
    )


√çf you want to unskip, then you have to use the full object (``BZ()``) and pass it a kwarg called
``unblock``. When the function in ``unblock`` resolves to a truthy value, the test won't be skipped.
If the blocker does not block, the ``unblock`` is not called. There is also a ``custom_action`` that
will get called if the blocker blocks. if the action does nothing, then it continues with next
actions etc., until it gets to the point that it skips the test because there are blockers.
