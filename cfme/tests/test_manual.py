    exhaust the connection pool with enough web requests spinning up new
    puma threads. Thin, by contrast, still processes each request in a
    single thread by default. While this is usually slower, you don"t have
    the issues of multiple threads in flight at the same time.We should
    make puma the default web server but have an easy option to switch to
    thin in case there are thread issues with puma.To change the web
    server, change puma to thin in the advanced configuration:
    :server:

    UI/Webservice and web socket workers will

    it"s own proctitle and we configure the parts that we can. Thin does
    not, so it
