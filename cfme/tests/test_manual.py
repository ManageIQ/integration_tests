    From a bugPuma, by default is a threaded web server, which means each

    connection pool reserves connections to threads, it"s possible to
    exhaust the connection pool with enough web requests spinning up new
    puma threads. Thin, by contrast, still processes each request in a
    single thread by default. While this is usually slower, you don"t have
    the issues of multiple threads in flight at the same time.We should
    make puma the default web server but have an easy option to switch to
    thin in case there are thread issues with puma.To change the web
    server, change puma to thin in the advanced configuration:
    :server:
    :rails_server: pumaNote: Testers/users, the proctitle for
    UI/Webservice and web socket workers will
    look different in ps, top, etc. if you use thin instead of puma. Puma
    configures
    it"s own proctitle and we configure the parts that we can. Thin does
    not, so it
    will look like all the other workers.
