        testSteps:
            1. On the Openshift provider, create different namespaces and
               assign them Resource Quotas. Assign different fractional
               values to the CPU quotas like  `1.152` or `0.087` or `87m`.
            2. Refresh the CFME appliance
            3. Check the containers_quota_items table in the database
            4. Navigate to the namespace in the CFME GUI.
            5. Refresh the CFME appliance
            6. Check the containers_quota_items table in the database
        expectedResults:
            1. Resource Quota assigned successfully.
            2. Appliance refreshed successfully.
            3. Database in `container_quota_items` table should contain
               both old and current values.            Newly added quotas
               should have `created_at` field set.
            4. Verify the GUI displays the correct data and the fractional
               values are formatted properly.
            5. Appliance refreshed successfully.
            6. Verify duplicate records were not added to the table

               as multiple rows â€” old value with `deleted_on` field set,
               and new value with approximately same `created_at`.
            4. Verify the GUI displays the correct data and the fractional
               values are formatted properly.
            5. Verify the update was successful
            6. Appliance refreshed successfully.
            7. Verify multiple values with both (created_at, deleted_on)
               set and only last one with deleted_on=null.
