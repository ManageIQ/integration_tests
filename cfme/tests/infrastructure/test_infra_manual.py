               - column headings(hosts) are displayed vertically
               - a smaller, simpler, icon is displayed (represents 3rd quadrant) for the hosts.
               - on parent rows, "% Matched" is displayed as "%".
               - on child(leaf) rows, color coded values are replaced with checkmarks for
                 matching, and x's for non-matching values
