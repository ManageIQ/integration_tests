                4. All hosts are still displayed but now in compressed mode:
                - column headings(hosts) are displayed vertically
                - a smaller, simpler, icon is displayed (represents 3rd quadrant) for the hosts.
                - on parent rows, "% Matched" is displayed as "%".
                - on child(leaf) rows, color coded values are replaced with checkmarks for
                matching, and x's for non-matching values
