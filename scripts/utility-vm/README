make

After the make finishes, you should have utility_vm.qcow2 file in the current
directory which you can upload to the provider.

To check the created image you may build an iso which will enable you to log-in
using password "changeme" as user "root" or "cloud-user"

$ make cloud_init.iso

$ qemu-kvm -nographic -m 1G \
         -drive file=utility_vm.qcow2 \
         -cdrom cloud_init.iso \
         -net nic,model=virtio \
         -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22

Note that this act will modify the image.
