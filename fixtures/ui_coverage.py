"""UI Coverage for a CFME/MIQ Appliance

Usage
-----

``py.test --ui-coverage``

General Notes
-------------
simplecov can merge test results, but doesn't appear to like working in a
multi-process environment. Specifically, it clobbers its own results when running
simultaneously in multiple processes. To solve this, each process records its
output to its own directory (configured in coverage_hook). All of the
individual process' results are then manually merged (coverage_merger) into one
big json result, and handed back to simplecov which generates the compiled html
(for humans) and rcov (for jenkins) reports.

thing_toucher makes a best-effort pass at requiring all of the ruby files in
the rails root, as well as any external MIQ libs/utils outside of the rails
root (../lib and ../lib/util). This makes sure files that are never
required still show up in the coverage report.

Workflow Overview
-----------------

Pre-testing (``pytest_configure`` hook):

1. Add ``Gemfile.dev.rb`` to the rails root, then run bundler to install simplecov
   and its dependencies.
2. Install and require the coverage hook (copy ``coverage_hook`` to config/, add
   require line to the end of ``config/boot.rb``)
3. Restart EVM (Rudely) to start running coverage on the appliance processes:
   ``killall -9 ruby; sysemctl start evmserverd``
4. TOUCH ALL THE THINGS (run ``thing_toucher.rb`` with the rails runner).
   Fork this process off and come back to it later

Post-testing (``pytest_unconfigure`` hook):

1. Poll ``thing_toucher`` to make sure it completed; block if needed.
2. Stop EVM, but nicely this time so the coverage atexit hooks run:
   ``systemctl stop evmserverd``
3. Run ``coverage_merger.rb`` with the rails runner, which compiles all the individual process
   reports and runs coverage again, additionally creating an rcov report
4. Pull the coverage dir back for parsing and archiving
5. For fun: Read the results from ``coverage/.last_run.json`` and print it to the test terminal/log

Post-testing (e.g. ci environment):
1. Use the generated rcov report with the ruby stats plugin to get a coverage graph
2. Zip up and archive the entire coverage dir for review
